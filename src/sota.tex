\section{Definitions}

Air Traffic Control service (ATC) can be devided into: area control service (ACC), approach control service (APP) and aerodrome control service (TWR) \cite[Chapter 1]{doc4444} The main objective is to prevent collisions between aircraft in air or on land and to expedite the flow of air traffic. \cite[Chapter 2.2]{annex11}
The airspace in which ATC service is provided can be divided into Control area (CTA), Control Zones (CTR) and Controlled aerodromes (TWR). Control area contains airways, terminal control areas and other airspace. It extends upwards from specified altitude. Within CTA, terminal control areas (TMA) are established to help in arrival and departure at some airports.
Control zones are normally situated below CTA and encompass airspace used by flights arriving at and departing from aerodromes. The diameter of CTR is at least 5NM in direction from which airplanes approach. CTR extends from the ground at least to the lower limit of CTA, but may extend further. CTR may include several aerodromes situated close together. \cite[Chapter 2.10]{annex11}

\subsubsection{Area Control Service}
Area Control Service is an ATC service provided by area control centre (ACC) responsible for flights in Control Areas (CTA). Normally ACC is identified by the name of a nearby city, area or landmark. Smaller countries usually have one ACC, but many larger countries are controlled by several of them. ACCs usually control aircrafts in their en-route phase of flight. The ACC may be also responsible for flights to and from smaller aerodromes with no separate approach control service. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

\subsubsection{Approach Control Service}
Approach Control Service (APP) is ATC service that is responsible for the part of CTA and CTR required by arriving or departing controlled flights (TMA). The primary functions of APP is sequencing arriving aircrafts and assisting departing aircrafts becoming established on course. The arrival and departure functions can be divided into several positions on busy aerodromes. APP is usually identified by the name of the aerodrome which it is serving, but sometimes it's not colocated with TWR and is at distant ACC location. When no separate ACC exists, approach control service is provided by ACC or TWR. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

\subsubsection{Aerodrome Control Service}
Aerodrome control service is provided by a control tower (TWR) and is responsible for aircraft landing and taking off. It's also responsible for VFR flights in the CTR and for preventing collisions between aircrafts on the manoeuvring are of the aerodrome. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

\subsection{Airspace classes}

%celou kapitolu přepsat, je doslovně  zkopírovaná

The controlled airspace can furthermore be classified as Class A-G. Classes of airspace are mutually exclusive. Thus, airspace can be Class E and Restricted at the same time, but it cannot be both Class E and Class B at the same location and at the same time. \cite{nolan}

%On March 12, 1990, ICAO adopted the current airspace classification scheme.[1] The classes are fundamentally defined in terms of flight rules and interactions between aircraft and Air Traffic Control (ATC). Generally speaking, the ICAO airspaces allocate the responsibility for avoiding other aircraft, namely either to ATC (if separation is provided) or to the aircraft commander (if not). definice classes je z annexu 11 - použití v USA z Nolana

%ICAO adopted classifications
%Note: These are the ICAO definitions. Country-specific adaptations (such as "two-way communications" instead of "clearance" for Class C in the US) are discussed in the sections below.
%Class A: All operations must be conducted under IFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.
%Class B: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.
%Class C: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other and from flights operating under VFR, but VFR flights are not separated from each other. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of other VFR flights.
%Class D: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All flights are subject to ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of VFR flights. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of all other flights.
%Class E: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are subject to ATC clearance. Flights under VFR are not subject to ATC clearance. As far as is practical, traffic information is given to all flights in respect of VFR flights.
%Class F: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation will be provided, so far as practical, to aircraft operating under IFR. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.
%Class G: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation is not provided. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.
%Classes A–E are referred to as controlled airspace. Classes F and G are uncontrolled airspace.



Some key concepts are:

\paragraph{Class A}
Class A airspace extends from FL180 (18,000 feet (5,500 m) mean sea level MSL) to FL600 (approximately 60,000 feet (18,000 m) MSL) throughout the United States. (AIM 3-2-2) Unlike the altitude measurements used in other airspace classes, the FLnnn flight levels used in Class A airspace are pressure altitudes referenced to a standardized altimeter setting of 29.92" Hg and thus the true altitudes depend on local atmospheric pressure variations.

Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all flight operations in Class A airspace must be under ATC control, and must be operating IFR, under a clearance received prior to entry.

Since Class A airspace is normally restricted to instrument flight only, there are no minimum visibility requirements.

\paragraph{Class B}
An example of the Class B Airspace symbol surrounding Denver International Airport.
Class B airspace is defined around key airport traffic areas, usually airspace surrounding the busiest airports in the US according to the number of IFR operations and passengers served. The exact shape of the airspace varies from one Class B area to another, but in most cases it has the shape of an inverted wedding cake, with a series of circular \"shelves\" of airspace of several thousand feet in thickness centered on a specific airport. Each shelf is larger than the one beneath it. Class B airspace normally begins at the surface in the immediate area of the airport, and successive shelves of greater and greater radius begin at higher and higher altitudes at greater distances from the airport. Many Class B airspaces diverge from this model to accommodate traffic patterns or local topological or other features. The upper limit of Class B airspace is normally 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL. (AIM 3-2-3.a.)

All aircraft entering Class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance prior to entry and must be prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any Class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some Class B airspaces include special transition routes for VFR flight that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other Class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which VFR flights may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the Class B airspace). (AIM 3-2-3.b.)

VFR flights operating in Class B airspace must have three miles (5 km) of visibility and must remain clear of clouds (no minimum distance). (AIM 3-1-4 and 3-2-3.a.)

Class B airspace has the most stringent rules of all the airspaces in the United States. Class B has strict rules on pilot certification. Pilots operating in Class B airspace must have a private pilot's certificate, or have met the requirement of CFR 61.95. These are often interpreted to mean \"have an instructor's endorsement for having been properly trained in that specific Class B space.\" However, it does not apply to student pilots seeking sport or recreational certificates. Some Class B airports (within Class B airspaces) prohibit student pilots from taking off and landing there and are listed in the AIM section 3-2-3(b)2.

In addition to this, some Class B airspaces prohibit Special VFR flights.

Certain Class B airports have a Mode C veil, which encompasses airspace within thirty nautical miles of the airport. Aircraft operating within the Mode C veil must have an operating Mode C transponder (up to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL) unless the aircraft is certified without an engine-driven electrical system and it operates outside the Class B and below the ceiling of the Class B and below 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL.

\paragraph{Class C}
Class C space is structured in much the same way as Class B airspace, but on a smaller scale. Class C airspace is defined around airports of moderate importance that have an operational control tower and is in effect only during the hours of tower operation at the primary airport. The vertical boundary is usually 4,000 feet (1,200 m) above the airport surface. The core surface area has a radius of five nautical miles (9 km), and goes from the surface to the ceiling of the Class C airspace. The upper \"shelf\" area has a radius of ten nautical miles, and extends from as low as 1,200 feet (370 m) up to the ceiling of the airspace. A procedural Outer Area (not to be confused with the shelf area) has a radius of 20 nautical miles.(AIM 3-2-4)

All aircraft entering Class C airspace must establish radio communication with ATC prior to entry. The aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio and an operating Mode C (altitude reporting) radar transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying above the upper limit of Class C airspace upward to 10,000 feet MSL must have an operating Mode C transponder. VFR flights in Class C airspace must have three miles (5 km) of visibility, and fly an altitude at least 500 feet (150 m) below, 1,000 feet (300 m) above, and 2,000 feet (600 m) laterally from clouds. (AIM 3-2-4.c.)

There is no specific pilot certification required. Aircraft speeds must be below 200 knots (230 mph) at or below 2,500 feet (760 m) above the ground, and within 4 nautical miles (7 km) of the Class C airport. (AIM 3-2-4.c.5.)

\paragraph{Class D}
Class D airspace is generally cylindrical in form and normally extends from the surface to 2,500 feet (760 m) above the ground. The outer radius of the airspace is variable, but is generally 4 nautical miles. Airspace within the given radius, but in surrounding Class C or Class B airspace, is excluded. Class D airspace reverts to Class E or G during hours when the tower is closed, or under other special conditions. (AIM 3-2-5)

Two-way communication with ATC must be established before entering Class D airspace, but no transponder is required. VFR cloud clearance and visibility requirements are the same as Class C. (AIM 3-2-5.b.3)

\paragraph{Class E}
Controlled airspace which is neither Class A, B, C nor D. (AIM 3-2-6.a) In most areas of the United States, Class E airspace extends from 1,200 feet (370 m) AGL up to but not including 18,000 feet (5,500 m) MSL, the lower limit of Class A airspace. There are areas where Class E airspace begins at either the surface or 700 AGL, these areas are used to transition between the terminal and en-route environments (around non-towered airports). These areas are designated on sectional charts. Most airspace in the United States is Class E. The airspace above FL600 is also Class E. (AIM 3-2-6.e.7)No ATC clearance or radio communication is required for VFR flight in Class E airspace. VFR visibility and cloud clearance requirements are the same as for Class C and Class D airspaces when below 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL. Above 10000 ft MSL, the visibility requirement is extended to 5 miles (8 km) and the cloud clearance requirement is extended to 1,000 feet (300 m) below clouds, 1,000 feet (300 m) above, and 1 mile (1.6 km) laterally. (AIM 3-1-4)

\paragraph{Class F}
Class F is not used in the United States.

\paragraph{Class G}
Class G airspace includes all airspace below flight level 600 not otherwise classified as controlled. (AIM 3-3-1) There are no entry or clearance requirements for Class G airspace, even for IFR operations. Class G airspace is typically the airspace very near the ground (1200 feet or less), beneath Class E airspace.

Radio communication is not required in Class G airspace, even for IFR operations. Class G is completely uncontrolled.

VFR visibility requirements in Class G airspace are 1 mile (1.6 km) by day, and 3 miles (5 km) by night, for altitudes below 10,000 feet (3,050 m) MSL but above 1200 ft AGL. Beginning at 10,000 feet MSL, 5 miles (8 km) of visibility are required, day and night. Cloud clearance requirements are to maintain an altitude that is 500 feet below, 1000 feet above, 2000 horizontal; at or above 10,000 feet MSL, they are 1,000 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 1 mile laterally. By day at 1,200 feet (370 m) AGL and below, aircraft must remain clear of clouds, and there is no minimum lateral distance.

It should be noted that there are certain exceptions where Class G extends above 1,200 feet AGL. This is usually either over mountainous terrain (e.g., some areas in the Rocky Mountains), or over very sparsely populated areas (e.g., some parts of Montana and Alaska).

%The United States also defines categories of airspace that may overlap with classes of airspace. Special use airspace Alert areas Warning areas Restricted airspace Prohibited airspace Military operation area (MOA) Controlled Firing Areas (CFA) National Security Areas (NSA)

\subsubsection{Airspace Management}
ATM is generic term for any management activity for achieving the most eficient and flexible use of airspace avoiding permanent airspace segregation. %\textcolor{red}{zdroj jen z prezentace}
The goals are to improve coordination between civil and military agencies, optimise route network and airspace structure and develop a free route airspace concept.

The concept of Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) means that airspace should be treated as one continuous space that is being allocated according to user requirements. Any airspace segregation should only be temporary.

\subsubsection{Coordination within ATC}
unit $\leftrightarrow$ unit \\
ACC $\leftrightarrow$ APP \\
APP $\leftrightarrow$ TWR \\
sector $\leftrightarrow$ sector \\
sectors are within units

koordinaci mezi sektory popisuje \cite{doc4444} Doc 4444 Chapter 10
Detailed procedures are often subject to local regulations and rules.

Transferring unit/controller transfers the responsibility to control the aircraft to the accepting unit on point of transfer of control.

The transfer of control can be divided into three stages. First the flight is \bold{notified} to prepare for the transfer. Then the conditions of transfer of control are \bold{negotiated} with the transferring ATC unit and if necessary also with the accepting unit. After the parties \bold{agree}, the control is transferred to the accepting unit. his process can be achieved using automated means (AFTN, RDPS, FDPS, OLDI \textcolor{red}{?}) without using conventional telephone coordination. %\textcolor{red}{(Jakože mezi sektory, s letadlem domluva asi pořád probíhá.)} 
\cite[Chapter 10.1.1]{doc4444}

This means that the flight is at any time under the control of only one ATC unit and can't be transferred from one unit to another without consent of the accepting unit. Also if communication with the aircraft is transwerred to the next unit, that unit cannot change the learance of the aircraft before the point of control transfer.

Control of an aircraft shall be transferred from ACC to APP, and vice versa, at a time or point agreed between the two units. This time or point is normally stated in a LOA.
Except when otherwise specified, APP may issue clearances to any aircraft released to it by ACC without reference to ACC. If an aircraft executes a missed approach, if necessary, ACC shall be informed immediately and subsequent action coordinated. 
After coordination with APP, ACC may release an arriving aircraft directly to TWR if the entire approach will be made under VMC.\cite[Chapter 10.1.3.1]{doc4444}

This conversation is often conducted in the local native language or, when controllers are busy and occupied with other responsibilities, this communication may be conducted using body language (e.g. raising a hand or nodding the head). 
Such coordination is normally not specified in local rules, and it important that controllers are very careful to ensure there is no misunderstanding between them.
\cite[Chapter 4.3.5, 10.1.5]{doc4444}

ICAO requires that a flight plan (FPL) message containing basic flight plan data is forwarded to the first ACC at least 30 minutes in advance of the flight, and to successive ACCs at least 20 minutes in advance of the flight reaching their area. Normally, due to flow control procedures and general air traffic planning requirements, this minimum is increased to 1 hour or even more, depending on agreements between units. 
If ATC clearances change the route of flight so the aircraft will fly through other ATC areas of responsibility, a current flight plan (CPL) message must be forwarded to those units at least 20 minutes prior to entering their area. Normally, agreements between units will specify an increased time.
An estimate (EST) message shall be forwarded at least 20 minutes prior to a flight entering a unit’s area of responsibility. This message contains the essential control information such as estimate, level and SSR code. The 20 minute time period may be increased or decreased, based on unit requirements and agreements.

\subsection{Altimetry}
Výška nad mořem/terénem/tlak/potřeba referenční hladiny, závisí na teplotě=tlaku vzduchu

QNE - standardní nastavení - letí se podle flight levelů - výška od referenční hladiny 1013.2 hPa
QNH - letí se podle nadmořské výšky, je to hodnota tlaku na daném místě (typicky letišti) který po zadaání do výškoměru vrací správnou nadmořskou výšku
QFE - výška nad povrchem země v daném místě - typicky u letiště


Transition altitude
The TA is the altitude at or below which the vertical position is expressed in terms of altitudes. The TA is established by the appropriate ATS authority.

Transition level (TL) is flight level just above the TA. Transition layer is the layer between TA and TL. It is prohibited to fly on the level that is in the transition layer.

When the plane is descending the pilot changes from QNE to QNH when passing TL. When climbing pilot changes from QNH to QNE on TA.

Řídící musí včas předat letadlu hodnotu QNH a TL.

\subsection{Separation}
Vertical or horizontal separation shall be provided:

between all flights in Class A and B airspaces;
between IFR flights in Class C, D and E airspaces;
between IFR and VFR flights in Class C airspace;
between IFR and Special VFR flights; and
between Special VFR flights, when so prescribed.
\cite[Chapter 5.2]{doc4444}

Separation should be achieved by one of the following:
\bitem
\item vertiacal - planes are assigned different cruising levels
\item horizontal
	\bitem
	\item longitudinal - interval between planes flying on the same (converging, reciprocal) is maintained
	\item lateral - planes fly on different routes
	\eitem
\item composite - combination of the above

\subsection{Holding}
Holding procedure is a predefined manouvre that keeps the aircraft in predetermined airspace while waiting for clearance. The procedure is the same for VFR and IFR flights.
Expected Approach Time (EAT) is the time when arriving aircraft leaves the holding fix in order to complete its approach for landing. Holding fix is a geographical location that serves as a reference point for holding procedure.
\cite[Chapter 6.5.8]{doc4444}

Reasons for holding can be traffic congestion, delays at destination airport or aircraft problems.

If the delay is expected, the aircraft should be notified as soon as possible and if practical advised to reduce speed in order to absorb the delay. The ACC is normally responsible for clearing the aircraft to the holding fix including the instruction for the holding procedure itself and EAT.\\
The holding procedure (including the pattern etc.) is normally published beforehand. Otherwise ATC shall specify the details of the procedure. Normally the first arriving aircraft is at the lovest level and the following aircrafts at successively higher levels. Turbojet aircrafts can be held at higher levels in order to conserve fuel, but ther order must be retained.\\
Vertical separation is mantained amongst the aircrafts in the holding sequence. Vertical separation must be applied whenever other aircraft is within 5 minutes of the holding area.\cite[Chapter 6.5.5]{doc4444}

The EAT should be established for aircrafts expected to be delayed for 10 minutes or more and transmitted to the aircraft as soon as practicable. It should be retransmitted if the updated EAT differs from the previous time by 5 minutes or more.\cite[Chapter 6.5.7]{doc4444}
