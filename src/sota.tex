\chapter{Introduction to Air Traffic Management}

This chapter will provide basic introduction to the field of ATM (Air Traffic Management), starting with brief summary of the history of aviation and continuing with explanation of some basic terms and concepts that will be needed further.

The Air Traffic Management is an umbrella term for three services provided in aviation: Air Traffic Control (ATC), Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) and Aeronautical Information Services (AIS). The responsibility of ATC is to keep aircraft safely separated at all times, be it in the air or on the ground. ATFM prevents congestion in busy areas by predicting and controlling the flow of future air traffic. AIS is responsible for distribution of aeronautical information that are needed to maintain safe, efficient and regular air traffic. These information can contain for example current whether situation or notification on potential hazards at specific locations. \cite{atm}

This thesis focuses on Air Traffic Control and Air Traffic Flow Management in the vicinity of airport. The presence of relevant information in given place at appropriate time is assumed and not addressed in this thesis.

% QNH - letí se podle nadmořské výšky, je to hodnota tlaku na daném místě (typicky letišti) který po zadaání do výškoměru vrací správnou nadmořskou výšku
% QFE - výška nad povrchem země v daném místě - typicky u letiště


% Transition altitude
% The TA is the altitude at or below which the vertical position is expressed in terms of altitudes. The TA is established by the appropriate ATS authority.

% Transition level (TL) is flight level just above the TA. Transition layer is the layer between TA and TL. It is prohibited to fly on the level that is in the transition layer.

% When the plane is descending the pilot changes from QNE to QNH when passing TL. When climbing pilot changes from QNH to QNE on TA.

% Řídící musí včas předat letadlu hodnotu QNH a TL.

\section{Separation}

Along with transferring control over aircraft from one sector to another and applying standard operating procedures for take-off or landing is keeping air traffic separated one of the main duties of air traffic controller. Proper separation ensures security and eliminates risk of collision. \cite[Chapter 2]{order7110}

Vertical or horizontal separation must be provided for all flights in Class A and B airspaces, IFR flights in Class C, D and E airspaces and between IFR and VFR flights in Class C airspace. \cite[Chapter 5]{doc4444}

The rules air traffic controllers use to keep aircraft separated are called separation minima. Separation can be achieved in two basic ways: vertical and horizontal. Their description follows.

\subsection{Vertical}

Vertical separation is reached when ATC controller assigns planes different cruising levels. Historically vertical separation minima were set to 1000 ft (10FL) below FL290 and 2000 ft above FL290. This was due to the fact that altimeter precision decreases with increasing altitude. Over time more precise altimeters and combination with other means of measuring aircraft altitude allowed to decrease the 2000 ft separation minima and introduce the Reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) system. In the RVSM airspace the separation limit is 1000 ft up to FL410 and 2000 ft above this level. If the cruising altitude of two airplanes is greater or equal as the separation minima, the airplanes are considered as separated. \cite{aim}

Other rules can be applied, often different flight levels are reserved for aircraft flying in certain direction. Example of such rule can be that eastbound flights (with heading 0$^{\circ}$ – 179$^{\circ}$) fly on even tenths flight levels (FL20, FL40 etc.) and westbound flights (with heading 180$^{\circ}$ – 359$^{\circ}$) fly on odd tenths (FL10, FL30 etc.).

\subsection{Wake Turbulence Separation}

Wake turbulence is the air vortex formed behind every aircraft as it moves through the air. The strength and size of the vortex depends on the parameters of the aircraft (mass, size, speed, wing configuration, etc.). It's not visible and can cause hazardous situation for the following aircraft especially if it is smaller and lighter and therefore more susceptible to be affected by the vortex.

Special alertness is needed in conditions with light wind, because the turbulence won't dissipate quickly and may drift to parallel runway or descend to lower altitude into path of following aircraft.

\section{Holding}

Holding procedure is a predefined manoeuvre that keeps the aircraft in predetermined airspace while waiting for clearance. The procedure is the same for VFR and IFR flights. Holding fix is a geographical location that serves as a reference point for holding procedure. The pattern itself is defined by the holding fix, heading of the inbound leg and length of the pattern. \cite[Chapter 6]{doc4444} The pattern and some terms used for it's description are shown in Figure \ref{fig:holding}.

Reasons for holding can be traffic congestion, delays at destination airport or aircraft problems.

% %Doplnit popis jednotlivých entry procedures!

% If the delay is expected, the aircraft should be notified as soon as possible and if practical advised to reduce speed in order to absorb the delay. The ACC is normally responsible for clearing the aircraft to the holding fix including the instruction for the holding procedure itself and EAT.\\
% The holding procedure (including the pattern etc.) is normally published beforehand. Otherwise ATC shall specify the details of the procedure. Normally the first arriving aircraft is at the lovest level and the following aircrafts at successively higher levels. Turbojet aircrafts can be held at higher levels in order to conserve fuel, but ther order must be retained.\\
% Vertical separation is mantained amongst the aircrafts in the holding sequence. Vertical separation must be applied whenever other aircraft is within 5 minutes of the holding area.\cite[Chapter 6.5.5]{doc4444}

% The EAT should be established for aircrafts expected to be delayed for 10 minutes or more and transmitted to the aircraft as soon as practicable. It should be retransmitted if the updated EAT differs from the previous time by 5 minutes or more.\cite[Chapter 6.5.7]{doc4444}

% Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ICAO code KATL) has been the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998 with more than 94 million passengers in 2013. It has also the most landings and take-offs since 2005. The airport has 207 domestic and international gates which is the most at any airport. \cite{atlanta}
