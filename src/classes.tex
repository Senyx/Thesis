\section{Air Traffic Control}

The main objective of Air Traffic Control is to prevent collisions between aircraft in air or on the ground and to expedite the flow of air traffic. \cite[Chapter 2.2]{annex11} In order to do so effectively, the airspace is divided to separate areas which are controlled by different ATC services depending on their characteristics.

\subsection{Air Traffic Control Services}

ATC services can be divided into Area Control Service (ACC), Approach Control Service (APP) and Aerodrome Control Service (TWR) \cite[Chapter 1]{doc4444} 

The airspace in which ATC service is provided can be divided into Control Area (CTA) and Control Zones (CTR). Within CTA, Terminal Control Areas (TMA) are established to help in arrival and departure at some airports.

Control Zones are normally situated below CTA and encompass airspace used by flights arriving at and departing from aerodromes. CTR extends from the ground at least to the lower limit of CTA, but may extend further. CTR may include several aerodromes situated close together. \cite[Chapter 2.10]{annex11} The Figure \ref{fig:airspace} shows how the controlled airspace can be divided and which services provide control in which areas.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Area Control Service}

Area Control Service is an ATC service provided by Area Control Centre responsible for flights in Control Areas (CTA). Normally ACC is identified by the name of a nearby city, area or landmark. Smaller countries usually have one ACC, but many larger countries are controlled by several. ACCs usually control aircraft in their en-route phase of flight. The ACC may be also responsible for flights to and from smaller aerodromes with no separate approach control service. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

Control Area contains airways, Terminal Control Areas (TMA) and other airspace. It extends upwards from specified altitude.

\subsubsection{Approach Control Service}

Approach Control Service (APP) is ATC service that is responsible for the part of CTA and CTR required by arriving or departing controlled flights. This area is called Terminal Control Area or Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) in Europe. The primary functions of APP is sequencing arriving aircraft and assisting departing aircraft in becoming established on course. The arrival and departure functions can be divided into several positions on busy aerodromes. APP is usually identified by the name of the aerodrome which it is serving, but sometimes it's not collocated with TWR and is at distant ACC location. When no separate ACC exists, approach control service is provided by ACC or TWR. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

\subsubsection{Aerodrome Control Service}

Aerodrome Control Service is provided by a control tower (TWR) and is responsible for aircraft landing and taking off. It's also responsible for planes flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) in the CTR and for preventing collisions between aircraft on the manoeuvring area of the aerodrome. \cite[Chapter 3.2]{annex11}

% Transferring unit/controller transfers the responsibility to control the aircraft to the accepting unit on point of transfer of control.

% The transfer of control can be divided into three stages. First the flight is \bold{notified} to prepare for the transfer. Then the conditions of transfer of control are \bold{negotiated} with the transferring ATC unit and if necessary also with the accepting unit. After the parties \bold{agree}, the control is transferred to the accepting unit. his process can be achieved using automated means (AFTN, RDPS, FDPS, OLDI \textcolor{red}{?}) without using conventional telephone coordination. %\textcolor{red}{(Jakože mezi sektory, s letadlem domluva asi pořád probíhá.)}

% This means that the flight is at any time under the control of only one ATC unit and can't be transferred from one unit to another without consent of the accepting unit. Also if communication with the aircraft is transwerred to the next unit, that unit cannot change the learance of the aircraft before the point of control transfer.

\section{Airspace Classes}

The controlled airspace can be also classified in one of the Classes A-G. The classification is mutually exclusive co Class A airspace can't be also classified as Class D at the same time and in the same place. The classes define the flight rules used in the airspace, interactions between pilot and Air Traffic Control and most importantly the responsibility for avoiding other aircraft which can be assigned either to the ATC or to the pilot himself. \cite{annex11}

The definition of the classes is given by ICAO and is respected by most countries altough some differences in the definition can exist. The use of the classes is nation specific, some countries classify their whole airspace into just one or few classes, some use all classes. Which classes are used in which parts of the airspace also varies greatly. \cite{classes} The typical use of airspace classes can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:classes}.

% The controlled airspace can furthermore be classified as Class A-G. Classes of airspace are mutually exclusive. Thus, airspace can be Class E and Restricted at the same time, but it cannot be both Class E and Class B at the same location and at the same time. \cite{nolan}

% %On March 12, 1990, ICAO adopted the current airspace classification scheme.[1] The classes are fundamentally defined in terms of flight rules and interactions between aircraft and Air Traffic Control (ATC). Generally speaking, the ICAO airspaces allocate the responsibility for avoiding other aircraft, namely either to ATC (if separation is provided) or to the aircraft commander (if not).

%%definice classes je z annexu 11 - použití v USA z Nolana

% %ICAO adopted classifications
% %Note: These are the ICAO definitions. Country-specific adaptations (such as "two-way communications" instead of "clearance" for Class C in the US) are discussed in the sections below.
% %Class A: All operations must be conducted under IFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.
% %Class B: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.
% %Class C: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other and from flights operating under VFR, but VFR flights are not separated from each other. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of other VFR flights.
% %Class D: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All flights are subject to ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of VFR flights. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of all other flights.
% %Class E: Operations may be conducted under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are subject to ATC clearance. Flights under VFR are not subject to ATC clearance. As far as is practical, traffic information is given to all flights in respect of VFR flights.
% %Class F: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation will be provided, so far as practical, to aircraft operating under IFR. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.
% %Class G: Operations may be conducted under IFR or VFR. ATC separation is not provided. Traffic Information may be given as far as is practical in respect of other flights.
% %Classes A–E are referred to as controlled airspace. Classes F and G are uncontrolled airspace.



% Some key concepts are:

% \paragraph{Class A}
% Class A airspace extends from FL180 (18,000 feet (5,500 m) mean sea level MSL) to FL600 (approximately 60,000 feet (18,000 m) MSL) throughout the United States. (AIM 3-2-2) Unlike the altitude measurements used in other airspace classes, the FLnnn flight levels used in Class A airspace are pressure altitudes referenced to a standardized altimeter setting of 29.92" Hg and thus the true altitudes depend on local atmospheric pressure variations.

% Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all flight operations in Class A airspace must be under ATC control, and must be operating IFR, under a clearance received prior to entry.

% Since Class A airspace is normally restricted to instrument flight only, there are no minimum visibility requirements.

% \paragraph{Class B}
% An example of the Class B Airspace symbol surrounding Denver International Airport.
% Class B airspace is defined around key airport traffic areas, usually airspace surrounding the busiest airports in the US according to the number of IFR operations and passengers served. The exact shape of the airspace varies from one Class B area to another, but in most cases it has the shape of an inverted wedding cake, with a series of circular \"shelves\" of airspace of several thousand feet in thickness centred on a specific airport. Each shelf is larger than the one beneath it. Class B airspace normally begins at the surface in the immediate area of the airport, and successive shelves of greater and greater radius begin at higher and higher altitudes at greater distances from the airport. Many Class B airspaces diverge from this model to accommodate traffic patterns or local topological or other features. The upper limit of Class B airspace is normally 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL. (AIM 3-2-3.a.)

% All aircraft entering Class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance prior to entry and must be prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any Class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some Class B airspaces include special transition routes for VFR flight that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other Class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which VFR flights may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the Class B airspace). (AIM 3-2-3.b.)

% VFR flights operating in Class B airspace must have three miles (5 km) of visibility and must remain clear of clouds (no minimum distance). (AIM 3-1-4 and 3-2-3.a.)

% Class B airspace has the most stringent rules of all the airspaces in the United States. Class B has strict rules on pilot certification. Pilots operating in Class B airspace must have a private pilot's certificate, or have met the requirement of CFR 61.95. These are often interpreted to mean \"have an instructor's endorsement for having been properly trained in that specific Class B space.\" However, it does not apply to student pilots seeking sport or recreational certificates. Some Class B airports (within Class B airspaces) prohibit student pilots from taking off and landing there and are listed in the AIM section 3-2-3(b)2.

% In addition to this, some Class B airspaces prohibit Special VFR flights.

% Certain Class B airports have a Mode C veil, which encompasses airspace within thirty nautical miles of the airport. Aircraft operating within the Mode C veil must have an operating Mode C transponder (up to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL) unless the aircraft is certified without an engine-driven electrical system and it operates outside the Class B and below the ceiling of the Class B and below 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL.

% \paragraph{Class C}
% Class C space is structured in much the same way as Class B airspace, but on a smaller scale. Class C airspace is defined around airports of moderate importance that have an operational control tower and is in effect only during the hours of tower operation at the primary airport. The vertical boundary is usually 4,000 feet (1,200 m) above the airport surface. The core surface area has a radius of five nautical miles (9 km), and goes from the surface to the ceiling of the Class C airspace. The upper \"shelf\" area has a radius of ten nautical miles, and extends from as low as 1,200 feet (370 m) up to the ceiling of the airspace. A procedural Outer Area (not to be confused with the shelf area) has a radius of 20 nautical miles.(AIM 3-2-4)

% All aircraft entering Class C airspace must establish radio communication with ATC prior to entry. The aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio and an operating Mode C (altitude reporting) radar transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying above the upper limit of Class C airspace upward to 10,000 feet MSL must have an operating Mode C transponder. VFR flights in Class C airspace must have three miles (5 km) of visibility, and fly an altitude at least 500 feet (150 m) below, 1,000 feet (300 m) above, and 2,000 feet (600 m) laterally from clouds. (AIM 3-2-4.c.)

% There is no specific pilot certification required. Aircraft speeds must be below 200 knots (230 mph) at or below 2,500 feet (760 m) above the ground, and within 4 nautical miles (7 km) of the Class C airport. (AIM 3-2-4.c.5.)

% \paragraph{Class D}
% Class D airspace is generally cylindrical in form and normally extends from the surface to 2,500 feet (760 m) above the ground. The outer radius of the airspace is variable, but is generally 4 nautical miles. Airspace within the given radius, but in surrounding Class C or Class B airspace, is excluded. Class D airspace reverts to Class E or G during hours when the tower is closed, or under other special conditions. (AIM 3-2-5)

% Two-way communication with ATC must be established before entering Class D airspace, but no transponder is required. VFR cloud clearance and visibility requirements are the same as Class C. (AIM 3-2-5.b.3)

% \paragraph{Class E}
% Controlled airspace which is neither Class A, B, C nor D. (AIM 3-2-6.a) In most areas of the United States, Class E airspace extends from 1,200 feet (370 m) AGL up to but not including 18,000 feet (5,500 m) MSL, the lower limit of Class A airspace. There are areas where Class E airspace begins at either the surface or 700 AGL, these areas are used to transition between the terminal and en-route environments (around non-towered airports). These areas are designated on sectional charts. Most airspace in the United States is Class E. The airspace above FL600 is also Class E. (AIM 3-2-6.e.7)No ATC clearance or radio communication is required for VFR flight in Class E airspace. VFR visibility and cloud clearance requirements are the same as for Class C and Class D airspaces when below 10,000 feet (3,000 m) MSL. Above 10000 ft MSL, the visibility requirement is extended to 5 miles (8 km) and the cloud clearance requirement is extended to 1,000 feet (300 m) below clouds, 1,000 feet (300 m) above, and 1 mile (1.6 km) laterally. (AIM 3-1-4)

% \paragraph{Class F}
% Class F is not used in the United States.

% \paragraph{Class G}
% Class G airspace includes all airspace below flight level 600 not otherwise classified as controlled. (AIM 3-3-1) There are no entry or clearance requirements for Class G airspace, even for IFR operations. Class G airspace is typically the airspace very near the ground (1200 feet or less), beneath Class E airspace.

% Radio communication is not required in Class G airspace, even for IFR operations. Class G is completely uncontrolled.

% VFR visibility requirements in Class G airspace are 1 mile (1.6 km) by day, and 3 miles (5 km) by night, for altitudes below 10,000 feet (3,050 m) MSL but above 1200 ft AGL. Beginning at 10,000 feet MSL, 5 miles (8 km) of visibility are required, day and night. Cloud clearance requirements are to maintain an altitude that is 500 feet below, 1000 feet above, 2000 horizontal; at or above 10,000 feet MSL, they are 1,000 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 1 mile laterally. By day at 1,200 feet (370 m) AGL and below, aircraft must remain clear of clouds, and there is no minimum lateral distance.

% It should be noted that there are certain exceptions where Class G extends above 1,200 feet AGL. This is usually either over mountainous terrain (e.g., some areas in the Rocky Mountains), or over very sparsely populated areas (e.g., some parts of Montana and Alaska).

% %The United States also defines categories of airspace that may overlap with classes of airspace. Special use airspace Alert areas Warning areas Restricted airspace Prohibited airspace Military operation area (MOA) Controlled Firing Areas (CFA) National Security Areas (NSA)
