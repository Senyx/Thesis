\chapter{Introduction to Air Traffic Management}

This chapter will provide basic introduction to the field of ATM (Air Traffic Management), starting with brief summary of the history of aviation and continuing with explanation of some basic terms and concepts that will be needed further.

The Air Traffic Management is an collective term for three services provided in aviation: Air Traffic Control (ATC), Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) and Aeronautical Information Services (AIS). The responsibility of ATC is to keep aircraft safely separated at all times, be it in the air or on the ground. ATFM prevents congestion in busy areas by predicting and controlling the flow of future air traffic. AIS is responsible for distribution of aeronautical information that are needed to maintain safe, efficient and regular air traffic. These information can contain for example current whether situation or notification on potential hazards at specific locations. \cite{atm}

This thesis focuses on Air Traffic Control and Air Traffic Flow Management in the vicinity of airport. The presence of relevant information in given place at appropriate time is assumed and not addressed in this thesis.

\section{Used Units}

Heading is the direction in which the plane's nose is pointing. It is measured in degrees in clockwise direction with $0 ^{\circ}$ being north, $90 ^{\circ}$ east, $180 ^{\circ}$ south and $270 ^{\circ}$ being west. Note that the direction of flight doesn't have to correspond to the plane's heading, this happens typically in situations with crosswind when the the heading must be adjusted according to the wind's direction and strength in order to achieve desired direction of flight.

Distances are measured in nautical miles (NM) with 1 NM equal to 1.852 km.

Speed is measured in knots (kt) with 1 kt being 1 NM per hour. Indicated airspeed is the actual reading from plane's instruments. Calibrated airspeed adjusts the value for instrument, installation and position errors. True airspeed describes the speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding mass of air. At standard sea level conditions the calibrated airspeed and true airspeed are equal. Ground speed is the plane's speed relative to the ground instead of the air, as the air itself can be moving.

\subsection{Altimetry}

Aircraft altitude is measured either in feet (ft) or in flight levels (FL). Flight level is defined by a specific barometric pressure and is expressed in hundreds of feet. The pressure is derived from the International standard sea-level pressure (1013.25 hPa) and therefore may not equal to the actual altitude. To determine the true altitude the pilot must know the atmospheric pressure at given space as the reading from the instruments depend on it. This value is provided by the air traffic control. The true altitude can be expressed either as altitude above sea level or above ground level, which value is used depends on agreement between pilot and air traffic controller.

Because the altitudes measured in feet and in flight levels don't equal the vertical separation cannot be ensured between aircraft using different measuring method. Therefore a transitional altitude is established. Above this altitude the altitude is measured in flight levels which removes the necessity to update the local air pressure. Below the transitional altitude the true altitude is used, because precise altitude values are needed for takeoff and landing. The transition altitude and corresponding transition level are established by the air traffic control. Before crossing this altitude ground controller must provide the transitional altitude and local air pressure to the pilot. AgentFly currently uses altitudes derived from the International standard sea-level pressure.

\section{Separation}

Along with transferring control over aircraft from one sector to another and applying standard operating procedures for take-off or landing is keeping air traffic separated one of the main duties of air traffic controller. Proper separation ensures security and eliminates risk of collision. \cite[Chapter 2]{order7110}

Vertical or horizontal separation must be provided for all flights in Class A and B airspaces, IFR flights in Class C, D and E airspaces and between IFR and VFR flights in Class C airspace. \cite[Chapter 5]{doc4444}

The rules air traffic controllers use to keep aircraft separated are called separation minima. Separation can be achieved in two basic ways: vertical and horizontal. Their description follows.

\subsection{Vertical}

Vertical separation is reached when ATC controller assigns planes different cruising levels. Historically vertical separation minima were set to 1000 ft (10FL) below FL290 and 2000 ft above FL290. This was due to the fact that altimeter precision decreases with increasing altitude. Over time more precise altimeters and combination with other means of measuring aircraft altitude allowed to decrease the 2000 ft separation minima and introduce the Reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) system. In the RVSM airspace the separation limit is 1000 ft up to FL410 and 2000 ft above this level. If the cruising altitude of two airplanes is greater or equal as the separation minima, the airplanes are considered as separated. \cite{aim}

Other rules can be applied, often different flight levels are reserved for aircraft flying in certain direction. Example of such rule can be that eastbound flights (with heading 0$^{\circ}$ – 179$^{\circ}$) fly on even tenths flight levels (FL20, FL40 etc.) and westbound flights (with heading 180$^{\circ}$ – 359$^{\circ}$) fly on odd tenths (FL10, FL30 etc.).

\subsection{Horizontal}

If two aircraft fly in the same altitude, they must be separated horizontally. The separation can be either lateral or longitudinal. The separation can be achieved both with or without using radar. When the radar is available, the controller sees the position of the aircraft directly on the radar screen. Without radar procedural control must be used which means that the controller must rely on position updates from the pilots over radio.

\subsubsection{Lateral}

Lateral separation presumes that the aircrafts follow different routes whose reserved airspace do not overlap. \cite[Chapter 7]{nolan} The width of the airway is 8NM. Aircraft are also considered laterally separated if holding over different fixes whose holding pattern airspace does not overlap. The lateral separation can be decreased to be less than 8NM in specified cases like two airplanes crossing ways over a fix flying in different directions.

\subsubsection{Longitudinal}

When two planes are flying along the same route or converging routes and are not separated vertically, they must use longitudinal separation. For the separation to be applied to two aircraft, both must fly in the same speed or the leading aircraft must fly faster than the following.

The longitudinal separation can be defined as a time delay between when two aircraft fly over a specified position or as minimal distance between the aircraft in nautical miles (NM). The separation minima differ if the planes are flying on the same track, or on reciprocal or crossing tracks.

For planes flying on the same track the basic separation minimum is 15 minutes, if the navigational aids allow for frequent position and speed updates the separation may be decreased to 10 minutes. If the preceding aircraft flies 20 kt or more faster than the following, the separation is 5 minutes, if the preceding aircraft flies more than 40 kt faster, the separation can be as low as 3 minutes. \cite[Chapter 5]{doc4444}

For airplanes on crossing paths the separation minimum is 15 minutes or 10 minutes if frequent position updates are available. The same applies for planes flying on the same track crossing paths vertically

\subsection{Separation in terminal area}

In terminal area similar separation rules apply as in en-route sectors. The aircraft must be separated either vertically, laterally or longitudinally. Vertical separation is used for holding aircraft. STARs are defined in such way that aircraft flying along the routes are separated either laterally on the same altitude or vertically if the STARs cross. This way the separation of aircraft flying on different STARs is always ensured. Planes flying on the same STAR use longitudinal separation with reduced separation minima that reflect the possible hazard of wake turbulence.

\subsubsection{Wake Turbulence Separation}

Wake turbulence is the air vortex formed behind every aircraft as it moves through the air. The strength and size of the vortex depends on the parameters of the aircraft (mass, size, speed, wing configuration, etc.). It's not visible and can cause hazardous situation for the following aircraft especially if it is smaller and lighter and therefore more susceptible to be affected by the vortex.

Special alertness is needed in conditions with light wind, because the turbulence won't dissipate quickly and may drift to parallel runway or descend to lower altitude into path of following aircraft.

ICAO specifies three categories of the aircraft based on their maximum certificated take-off mass as follows \cite[Chapter 4]{doc4444}:
\bitem
\item Heavy - 136 000 kg or more
\item Medium - 7 000 – 136 000 kg
\item Light - 7 000 kg or less
\eitem

Super Heavy category is also used to provide separation behind very large aircraft like Airbus A380-800.

Table \ref{tab:wake_separation} shows the separation minima defined by FAA used for aircraft following behind another aircraft at the same altitude or less than 1000ft when both aircraft are using the same runway or parallel runways separated by less than 2500ft.

\section{Holding pattern}

Holding procedure is a predefined manoeuvre that keeps the aircraft in predetermined airspace while waiting for clearance. The procedure is the same for VFR and IFR flights. Holding fix is a geographical location that serves as a reference point for holding procedure. The pattern itself is defined by the holding fix, heading of the inbound leg and length of the pattern. \cite[Chapter 6]{doc4444} The pattern and some terms used for it's description are shown in Figure \ref{fig:holding}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/holding.png}
    \caption{Holding pattern with examples of entry}
    \label{fig:holding}
\end{figure}

Reasons for holding can be traffic congestion, delays at destination airport or aircraft problems.

The holding procedure is usually published beforehand but ATC can specify the details of an ad hoc holding pattern if the situation calls for it. The turn direction is usually right, but left-hand turn holding patterns can be used if needed.

Several planes can hold over the same holding fix, these airplanes must be separated vertically. Normally the airplane to arrive first holds on the lowest level with the following aircraft using successively higher levels. Jet aircraft can hold at higher levels to save fuel, but the order must be retained.\cite[Chapter 6]{doc4444}

Maximum holding speeds are established by ICAO to keep the aircraft within the protected holding space. Aircraft can also have specific holding speed prescribed by the manufacturer. This speed is lower than typical cruising speed and is used in order to conserve fuel. The maximum speeds are defined as follows \cite[Section 6]{doc8168}:

\begin{itemize}
\item up to 14000 ft: 230 kt
\item 14000 ft to 20000 ft: 240 kt
\item 20000 ft to 34000 ft: 265 kt
\item more than 34000 ft: 0.83 Mach
\end{itemize}

There are three different entry procedures for the holding pattern depending on in which direction the aircraft arrives to the holding fix. Direct entry is straight forward, the plane flies directly to the holding fix and turns outbound as soon as the holding fix is reached. In offset entry aircraft flies over the holding fix into the protected area and through the area and then turns back at the outbound end and continues the holding from there. In parallel entry the plane flies over the holding fix and continues parallel to the inbound leg on the non-holding side. At the outbound end the plane turns and continues back to the holding fix an holds from there. The entry procedures are indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:holding}.

\section{Horizontal diversion manoeuvre}

The horizontal diversion manoeuvre can be used either to keep separation between aircraft in collision avoidance or to extend the aircraft flight plan in order to postpone its arrival to given location (typically airport).

The manoeuver is defined by the diversion angle, length of the diversion and return point. The ATC orders the pilot to divert to given magnetic heading and await further instruction. The pilot turns as soon as possible abandoning the current flight plan. When the plane reaches desired position, ATC orders the pilot to change direction back to a return point and resume flight on the original flight plan from the return point on.

Figure \ref{fig:diversion} shows the representation of diversion manoeuvre in the ATC plan. The diversion is represented by the whole area of the shape as the precise times of the turn applications are uncertain before the pilot actually performs them. The ATC plan is updated and the area of uncertainty gets smaller as the flight progresses through the manoeuvre.
